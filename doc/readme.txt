Twomile Multisite Search Helper
v 1.1.0

This plugin adds a very simple cross-site search feature for your multisite EE
environment.  It works outside the normal EE search feature, so you may use either
or both	as you see fit.  It is not a feature-rich plugin, but it does respect
open-vs-closed entry statuses, and it does check your search-enabled custom
weblog fields.  Weblog entries configured as pages in the Pages module are
linked to their page URI.  All other entries are linked to the path provided
in the weblog preferences.  

To Install and Use this Plugin:

  1.  Copy pi.multisite_search.php to your plugins directory.
  2.  Visit your Plugin Manager and verify the plugin is available.
  3.  Click the plugin name to view usage instructions.

Please email me or post in the forums and let me know if you find this plugin useful.  
Though its practical life may be short (EE is expected to include its own version of 
this functionality in an upcoming release) it solves a problem I have right now.  Maybe
it will do the same for you.
